Task List

Please feel free to do these tasks in any order, but take note that they are
listed in the order your team has prioritized completing them.

Reminder that you are NOT expected to complete all tasks in 1 hour. You are
expected to write clean, readable code. Remember to add comments explaining
what you were working on if you run out of time in the middle of a task.

1.  Add the method to Neighborhood.java with the prototype defined in our
    design document:
      List<CompletePlaceData> getPlaces(LatLng latLng, int maxResults);
    getPlaces(...) takes in a latLng and returns a list of at most maxResults
    CompletePlaceData for the places closest to latLng. Note that you will need
    to define the class CompletePlaceData, which should include all of the data
    in PlaceData, plus the string returned by ImageServer. Your method can use
    any of the methods exposed by PlaceDataServer and ImageServer, which you can
    use directly as libraries.

2.  You notice that there seems to be something wrong with PlaceDataServer's
    getNearbyPlaces(...) method. When you ask the engineer that runs PDS about
    it, they tell you they know it's broken, but don't have the bandwidth to
    fix it right now. Fix the implementation for getNearbyPlaces(...). If your
    solution is not optimal, consider adding comments on what you could change
    to make it more efficient. Additionally, consider adding test cases to
    Runner so that you could catch a regression in the future.

3.  Once getNearbyPlaces(...) is fixed, it will be expensive to call every time
    a user reloads the page. Add the cache talked about in the design document
    (Option C) -- your cache should store the data received for a given LatLng.
    You are welcome to make this cache implementation as simple or complex as
    you like, but you are encouraged to make sure it is well documented and
    appropriately decomposed.
