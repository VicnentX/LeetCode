/*
You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.



Example 1:

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]


Constraints:

0 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

/**
 * my solution takes advantage of what we're guaranteed in the problem:
 *
 * guaranteed to have a word following an identifier (allows me to use indexOf ' ' freely).
 * letter logs need to be ordered lexicographically, so we can use built in compare function when we know we have two.
 * number logs need to be sorted naturally, so we just say they're all "equal" to eachother and trust java's built in sort feature to be stable.
 * number logs need to be after letter logs, so once we find out they're different, we return one of the other and short-circuit.
