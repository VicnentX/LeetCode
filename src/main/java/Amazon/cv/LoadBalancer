design a load balancer

eg. there is N servers and everytime just one request to a website
one of the servers will deal with this request.

so

method1
design a PriorityQueue to store a pair (id of server , usage frequency)

method2
use LinkedHashMap to solve this problem , everytime choose the first element of the map and LRU it.
