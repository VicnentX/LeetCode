As others have cogently pointed out,
it doesn't matter.
All logarithms differ from each other by a constant only dependent on the bases involved.
Because these factors are constants,
they are irrelevant for the purposes of asymptotic analysis. Second,
as far determining the implied base, it depends on context.
As a rough rule of thumb use the following:
1. When a mathematician writes log n he means the natural logarithm.
2. When a computer scientist writes log n he means base-two.
3. When an engineer writes log n he means base-ten. These are usually true. – jason

So you can think of it as O(log2X) = O(log10X)
Also to mention that logarithms are related by some constant.

So
log₁₀(x) = log₂(x) / log₂(10)
