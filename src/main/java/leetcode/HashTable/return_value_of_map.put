The method put has a return type same with the value:

@Override
    public V put(K key, V value) {
        return putImpl(key, value);
    }
The method associates the specified value with the specified key in this map. If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced.
It returns the previous value associated with key, or null if there was no mapping for key.So, your points are right.
